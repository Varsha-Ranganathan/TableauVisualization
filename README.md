# Tableau Visualization
## Flight Prices Data Visualization
### Overview
This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis and visualization of flight price data. The goal is to uncover trends and patterns that affect flight pricing, such as time of booking, class of travel, and airline choice. The analysis and subsequent visualization offer valuable insights for consumers to make informed decisions when booking flights, and for businesses to understand the dynamics of flight pricing.

### Tools and Techniques
The project uses a robust set of tools and methodologies to analyze and present data:

Jupyter Notebook: All Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted using Jupyter Notebook, an open-source web application that allows for interactive computing and the creation of live code, visualizations, and narrative text.

Tableau Public: The visualization is brought to life using Tableau Public, a leading platform for data visualization. Tableau's interactive dashboard capabilities allow users to delve into the data through dynamic charts and graphs.

Python: For the EDA, Python programming language, along with libraries such as pandas and numpy, is utilized for data manipulation and matplotlib and seaborn for preliminary visualizations.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA component of this project is crucial for understanding the underlying structure of the data. Through descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and data distribution visualization, we draw insights that inform the design of the Tableau dashboard.

### Key EDA insights include:

Distribution of flight prices across different airlines and classes
Impact of flight duration on price
Seasonal and temporal trends in flight pricing
The detailed EDA can be found in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook file within this repository.

### Tableau Dashboard
The Tableau dashboard is an interactive tool that provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the data. The visualization emphasizes comparative analysis of flight prices across various factors such as airline, class, and route.

### Features of the Tableau Dashboard:

Interactivity: Users can select specific airlines, cities, or date ranges to view tailored information.
Comparative Analysis: The dashboard compares factors influencing flight prices with visualizations that highlight the differences.
Usability: Designed with user experience in mind, the dashboard is intuitive and accessible to individuals without a data analysis background.
Accessing the Dashboard
To view the Tableau dashboard, please follow the direct link: [Flight Prices Visualization Dashboard.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/varsha.ranganathan3872/viz/FlightPricesVisualization/Dashboard1?publish=yes)

The dashboard is hosted on Tableau Public and can be accessed by anyone. Feel free to interact with the various elements of the dashboard to explore the data in depth.

### Conclusion
This project serves as a detailed exploration of flight prices, presented in a way that is accessible to both data enthusiasts and the general public. The findings from the EDA lay the groundwork for the visualizations, which provide a clear, interactive means of understanding what factors influence flight prices.
